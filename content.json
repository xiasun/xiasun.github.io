Using ShadowSocks on Windows is pretty easy, we just have to run a GUI and do some server configuration on it. However, let ShadowSocks works properly on Ubuntu do require some works. This post assumes no prior environment installed &amp; configured except Ubuntu itself (ShadowSocks server access is required, you could buy one or set up one yourself). Step 1: Install ShadowSocks through PIPShadowSocks installed from apt-get is of low version and cannot support many password method, I recommend a installation using PIP.Install PIP:1sudo apt-get install python-pip Install ShadowSocks through PIP1pip install shadowsocks Step 2: ShadowSocks clients ConfigurationAfter installed ShadowSocks we have to set server IP, password and many arguments for a proper connection, you may configure it using Terminal commands, but I recommend using a configuration file.Create a ShadowSocks configuration file (json) and put it somewhere you like with content below12345678&#123;\"server\": \"for.example.xyz\",\"server_port\": 10644,\"local_port\": 1080,\"password\": \"123456\",\"timeout\": 600,\"method\": \"rc4-md5\"&#125; Now you can start your ShadowSocks client through command below1sslocal -c path/to/your/configuration/file/created/above start Step 3.1: Firefox proxy configurationShadowSocks follows socks5 proxy, so we cannot directly access http pages. Firefox is the default browser of ubuntu, so we first have to configure proxy on it.Go to “Preference-&gt;Advanced-&gt;Network-&gt;Connection-&gt;Setting”, select “Manual proxy configuration” and enter ShadowSocks default socks host 127.0.0.1 with port 1080, don’t forget to select the “SOCKS v5” checkbox. Step 3.2: Chrome proxy configurationAfter configure proper proxy on Firefox, you may want to use Chrome now. First download and install Chrome from Firefox (you may use apt-get but for these commonly-used and well-developed software I prefer to download from browser directly). Then we need a proxy management plugin, I recommend Switch Omega. However, install Chrome plugin requires connection to google which is not easy somewhere, so we first use Terminal command below to configure chrome proxy to conncect Google.1google-chrome --proxy-server=socks5://127.0.0.1:1080 Now chrome is started with proxy above. Now search for Switch Omega in Google Chrome App Center and install it. After install Switch Omega on Chrome, configure our socks5 proxy in it like below.Now next time you could start Chrome freely and use proxy to connect google.

As a fucking mediocre student, I still have no idea whether it’s correct for me to further my graduate study. Hope I could do every thing step by step in the next 2.5 years.I don’t have that much freedom for my graduate study &amp; projects, I just hope I could: Improve my body and appearance physically; Spare more time for those things that could benefit my future career; Step deeper in my lab study instead of simply finishing tasks, try to do some papers and patents; Collect and absorb every fragment knowledge I meet in my study and life.
